# Socket Programming Assignment - Group Chat and File Transfer

## Introduction
Welcome to your 7th assignment! This assignment focuses on building a command-line interface (CLI) **client-server** application using **socket programming** in Java. The objective is to create a robust and efficient mechanism for sending text messages between multiple clients and transferring text files from the server side to the client side.

## Assignment Overview
The assignment comprises two main tasks that the server needs to handle.

### Task 1: Group Chat - Sending Text Messages
In this task, the server will handle requests from multiple clients to send text messages in a group chat. Each client will be able to read the message content and the name of the sender in their own terminal.

To ensure reliable message delivery, it is recommended to implement error handling mechanisms.

### Task 2: File Transfer - Downloading Text Files
In this task, you will extend the functionality of the application to allow clients to download text files from the server.

The client should be able to view the list of available files on the server and select one for download. Once the file is downloaded, its name and contents will be displayed on the client side.


An essential feature that must be implemented is the server log, which records significant events and actions on the server-side for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the assignment, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository. (**DO NOT clone it! Fork it first**)

2. Clone the forked repository from your own GitHub account to your local machine.

3. The repository contains a README file and several text files (in the `data` directory), each storing the lyrics of a song.

4. Implement the client-side and server-side code as per the assignment requirements. Refer to the provided code comments and any additional guidelines mentioned in the code.

## Bonus Features
Consider implementing the following bonus features to enhance your application:

- User Interface: Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries to improve the user experience.

- Progress Tracking: Provide a way for clients to monitor the progress of file transfers, allowing them to track the download progress. If you are familiar with JavaFX, consider implementing this with JavaFX.

- Although writing adocumentation for this assignment is not mandatory (and won't earn extra points), it will help mentors understand your project's progress. Additionally, it will make your code more comprehensible for others if you decide to keep this assignment on your GitHub account.

## Submission
When you have completed the assignment, please prepare your submission as follows:

1. Include all relevant Java source code files for the client and server components, along with the text files.

2. (Optional) Provide any additional documentation or notes explaining your implementation details, design choices, and testing approach.

3. (Optional) If you implemented a GUI, include any necessary resources or instructions for successfully running the GUI.

4. Push your final code to the forked repository and send a PR (Pull Request) to your mentor. The submission deadline is **May 22nd (Khordad 2nd)**.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the assignment, please reach out to your mentors for assistance.

Best regards :)
