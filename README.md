# Seventh-Assignment-Socket-Programming

## Introduction
Welcome to your 7th assignment! This assignment focuses on building a CLI **client-server** structured application using **socket programming** in Java. The goal is to create a reliable and efficient mechanism for sending text messages between multiple clients and transferring text files from the server side to the client side.

## Assignment Overview
The server shall be able to handle **2 main tasks**.

### Task 1: Sending Text Messages in a Group Chat
In this task, the server shall handle requests from multiple clients to send text massages in the group chat. Each client shall be able to read the body of the massage and the name of the sender in their own terminal.

Also, it would be nice to implement mechanisms to handle errors and ensure reliable message delivery.

### Task 2: Downloading Text Files from the Server
In this task, you will extend the functionality of the application to allow clients to download text files from the server. 

Make sure that the client is be able to first see the list of the available files and then select one to download the file.

When the file is downloaded, the name and contents of it shall be displayed on the client side.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the assignment, follow these steps:

0. Fork this repository. (**DO NOT clone it! Fork first**)

1. Clone the forked repo from your own GitHub account to your local machine.

2. The forked repo contains the file of this readme and several text files, each storing a lyric of a song.

3. Implement the client-side and server-side code as per the assignment requirements. Refer to the provided comments and any additional guidelines mentioned in the code.

## Some Bonus Features You Might Want to Work on!

- User Interface: You may choose to add a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries can be used for this purpose.

- Progress Tracking: Provide a way to track the progress of file transfers, allowing clients to monitor the download progress. (Considering the fact that you know how to use JavaFX, implementing this part with JavaFX is welcomed!)

- Though writing documentation for this assignment is not necessary (and won't be given any extra points), writing one will first help the mentors understand how you have worked throughout the project and second, make your code more comprehensible for others (if you plan to keep this assignment on your GitHub account).

## Submission
When you have completed the assignment, please prepare your submission as follows:

1. Include all the relevant Java source code files for the client and server components besides the text files.

2. (Optional) Provide any additional documentation or notes that explain your implementation details, design choices, and testing approach.

3. (Optional) If you implemented a GUI, include any necessary resources or instructions for running the GUI successfully.

4. Push your final code to the repo you have forked and send a PR (Pull Request) to your mentor. The deadline for submission is **May 22nd (Khordad 2nd)**.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the assignment, please reach out to your mentors for assistance.
