# Seventh-Assignment-Socket-Programming

## Introduction
Welcome to your 7th assignment! This assignment focuses on building a **client-server** file transfer system using **socket programming** in Java. The goal is to create a reliable and efficient mechanism for uploading and downloading files between a client and a server.

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will implement a file transfer application with the following key features:

1. Client-Server Architecture: The application follows a client-server model, where the server manages incoming client connections and handles file transfers.

2. File Upload: Clients can upload files to the server by specifying the file's name and destination directory on the server.

3. File Download: Clients can request files from the server for download by providing the file's name and location.

4. Error Handling and Reliability: Implement mechanisms to handle errors and ensure the reliability of file transfers. Consider verifying the integrity of transferred files and handling network interruptions or failures.

5. Progress Tracking: Provide a way to track the progress of file transfers, allowing clients to monitor the upload/download progress. (Considering the fact that you know how to use JavaFX, implementing this part with JavaFX is welcomed!)

6. (Optional) User Interface: You may choose to add a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. Java's Swing or JavaFX libraries can be used for this purpose.

## Getting Started
To begin working on the assignment, follow these steps:

0. Fork this repository. (**DO NOT clone it! Fork first**)

1. Clone the forked repo from your own GitHub account to your local machine.

2. Familiarize yourself with the code structure and existing classes. You will find placeholders and comments that guide you in implementing the required functionality.

3. Implement the client-side and server-side code as per the assignment requirements. Refer to the provided comments and any additional guidelines mentioned in the code.

4. Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure correctness and robustness. Consider edge cases, error scenarios, and concurrent file transfers.

6. (Optional) If you choose to implement a GUI, design an intuitive interface that allows users to initiate transfers, view progress, manage files effectively, and more! The limit is your imagination.

7. Though writing documentation for this assignment is not necessary (and won't be given any extra points), writing one will first help the mentors understand how you have worked throughout the project and second, make your code more comprehensible for others (if you plan to keep this assignment on your GitHub account).

## Submission
When you have completed the assignment, please prepare your submission as follows:

1. Include all the relevant Java source code files for the client and server components.

2. (Optional) Provide any additional documentation or notes that explain your implementation details, design choices, and testing approach.

3. (Optional) If you implemented a GUI, include any necessary resources or instructions for running the GUI successfully.

4. Push your final code to the repo you have forked and send a PR (Pull Request) to your mentor. The deadline for submission is May 22nd (Khordad 2nd).

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the assignment, please reach out to your mentors for assistance.

Best regards,
